# Lean and Agile Principles for Empowering Teachers and Students in a Changing World: spoken by Founder and Ceo at new Employee Orientation
As the founder of MyWebClass.org, I am thrilled to welcome all of you to our team. We are embarking on an exciting journey to revolutionize education by creating a community of people dedicated to helping students succeed in the modern software industry.

Our mission is to provide educational opportunities and a practical, hands-on learning experience to students and teachers of all ages and backgrounds. We want to create a platform where everyone feels welcome to learn and grow, and we believe that our values are the key to achieving this mission.

At MyWebClass.org, we value people, learning, efficiency, and dependability. We understand that everyone has the potential to succeed, and we strive to create an inclusive and supportive environment where everyone feels included and valued. We believe that learning is a lifelong process, and we are committed to providing educational opportunities that help students and teachers gain experience with new technologies and learn advanced software engineering concepts. We recognize that time is a valuable resource, and we aim to provide a practical, hands-on learning experience that allows students and teachers to develop the skills they need to succeed in the modern software industry quickly. Finally, we understand the importance of being reliable and consistent, and we aim to provide a stable and dependable platform for students and teachers to learn and collaborate.

Our origin story began in 2023 when I, Keith Williams, founded MyWebClass.org. As a university lecturer with over 30 years of experience as a software engineer and entrepreneur, I saw the need to bridge the gap between educators and professionals in the software industry. I wanted to create a community of people committed to helping students of all ages and backgrounds succeed, and that's why I founded MyWebClass.org.

Now, we are at the first milestone in the development of our company. We want to launch a site as quickly as possible, but we also want to ensure that we launch a product that reflects our mission, vision, and values. That's why we are asking you, our new employees, to form teams to develop competing prototypes of the MyWebClass.org site that will compete in a competition to become the A/B versions of the site that we will test with our first customers.

We are making a customized learning management system that will enable us to deliver on our mission and values. However, to start, we need a site that will help us get the ball rolling. This site must embody our values and reflect our mission and vision.

As we begin this competition, I want to remind you of the importance of our values. People, learning, efficiency, and dependability are the cornerstones of our company, and we must ensure that these values are reflected in everything we do.

Thank you for joining us on this journey. Together, we can create a community of people committed to helping students of all ages and backgrounds succeed in the modern software industry. Let's get to work!
