# Team Management - Forming Teams: spoken by Your Project Leader

Dear Team Members,

We are thrilled to begin the first sprint of our web development project, and we want to encourage you to work together
in cross-functional teams of 2-3 people. By forming these teams, you will be able to pool your talents and work together
to create a more effective product. Each member of the team brings unique skills and perspectives to the table, and by
collaborating, you can create something that is greater than the sum of its parts.

## Here are some steps to help you form cross-functional teams:

Identify your skills: Think about what skills you bring to the table, such as technical expertise, design skills, or
marketing knowledge. This will help you identify what kind of team you should join.

Identify gaps: Once you know your skills, look for gaps that need to be filled. For example, if you have technical
expertise, you may want to look for team members who have design skills or marketing knowledge.

Reach out to potential team members: Talk to classmates who you think would be a good fit for your team. You can also
use our discussion board to find potential team members.

Meet with your team: Once you have identified potential team members, schedule a meeting to discuss your goals and how
you can work together effectively. Make sure to establish clear roles and responsibilities for each team member.

Work collaboratively: As you work on the project, make sure to communicate regularly with your team members and work
collaboratively to achieve your goals. You may find that working with people who have different skill sets can be a
little uncomfortable at first, but this can ultimately lead to more creative and innovative solutions.

By working together in cross-functional teams, you can create a website that is both functional and user-friendly. Let
us work together to revolutionize education and help teachers prepare students for a rapidly changing world.
