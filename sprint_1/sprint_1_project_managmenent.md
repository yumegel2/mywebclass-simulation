# Project Management

For this assignment, you will choose one of the project management techniques described below (Kanban, Scrum, or
Scrum-Ban) and use GitHub Project to manage your project according to that methodology. You will work in a team to create
a GitHub Project board that reflects your chosen methodology, and use it to manage your team's workflow and track
progress on a project of your choice.

## Here are the steps for completing this assignment:

1. Choose one of the project management techniques discussed in class (Kanban, Scrum, or Scrumban).
2. Create a new GitHub Project board that reflects your chosen methodology.
3. Customize the columns on your team board to match the workflow of your project and chosen methodology (see previous
   examples for recommended columns).
4. Add tasks or issues to the board as you create them during the operation of your project.
5. Assign tasks to team members, and track progress by moving them across the board as they are completed.
6. Hold meetings or stand-ups as needed to discuss progress, roadblocks, and plans for the next sprint or iteration.
7. Use GitHub features such as labels, milestones, and comments to communicate and collaborate with your team members.

Your team's GitHub Project board should be actively used and maintained throughout the duration of the assignment. You
should update the board regularly to reflect the current state of your project, and use it as a central hub for tracking
progress, assigning tasks, and communicating with your team members.

## Project Management Improvement Report

At the end of the assignment, you will create a presentation that explains why your team chose the project management
methodology. Your report should explain what you can improve in the next sprint and have any measurable indicators that
you can use to judge if your improvements result in improvements to your teams efficiency or product quality.

# Report Instructions - Presentation PPT file with no more than 10 slides
1. A short introduction that explains why your team chose the project management system.
2. A section to display Calculate a productivity rating for each team member   
   - Evaluate each members' performance by taking the total number of story points that each team member has completed and then divide that by the number of issues to come up with a productivity rating.
3. Each team member should have a slide with a brief statement on what they learned and how they will improve for the next sprint 
4. A slide with the following links
   1. Add a link to your project task board(s) you can have more than one
   2. Add a link to your projects issue queue 
   3. Add a link to your productivity task log file on your repository  

## Team Productivity Log

Create a table in a markdown file on your repository and share it with your team. Add columns for issue title,story points, issue link,
status, assigned to, assigned on, completed on, category, status notes. Each time a team member completes a task in the project
they need to create an issue on GitHub and add that link to this document.  Tasks can be the following categories: Feature, Bug, Docs, or Devops Task  

* Note: This log will be used to determine project contributions and evaluate if each member made adequate and equal contributions to the project.

## Research - You should do your own but this will get you started:
## Project Management: Spoken by the CEO
As the CEO of MyWebClass.org, I have a goal of combining the best of Lean and Agile methodologies to develop our products in the most efficient and effective way possible. One of the key principles of Lean is the idea of a pull process, where the focus is on delivering value to the customer based on their needs and preferences, rather than pushing out products based on what we think they want. By adopting a pull process, we can ensure that we're creating products that meet our customers' needs and provide maximum value.

At the same time, the Agile Manifesto is an important philosophy that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement. However, it's important to recognize that there are many different implementations of Agile, and not all of them will be the right fit for our team. That's why we need to carefully consider the different Agile methodologies out there, like Scrum, Kanban, and Scrumban, and choose the one that best aligns with our goals and values.

Ultimately, our goal is to create a culture of continuous improvement, where we're always looking for ways to work more efficiently, create more value, and better serve our customers. By adopting the best practices of Lean and Agile, we can achieve this goal and take our products to the next level.

### Kanban:

Kanban is a project management methodology that emphasizes visualizing work and limiting work in progress to improve
efficiency and throughput. The basic idea of Kanban is to use a physical or digital board to track the status of tasks
or work items, with columns representing different stages of the workflow. Teams using Kanban typically focus on
optimizing flow, minimizing bottlenecks, and continuously improving their process.

Minimum requirements: A physical or digital board, such as a whiteboard, sticky notes, or a Kanban software tool.

General process: Create a board that reflects your workflow and current state of work, add work items or tasks to the
board, and track progress through the workflow stages.

### Scrum:

Scrum is an agile methodology that emphasizes iterative development and teamwork. Scrum is designed to help teams
deliver high-quality products by focusing on collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement. The key features
of Scrum include sprint planning, daily stand-up meetings, sprint reviews, and retrospectives.

Minimum requirements: A product backlog, a sprint backlog, a sprint planning meeting, daily stand-up meetings, and a
sprint review.

General process: Create a product backlog of features or user stories, prioritize the backlog items, select items for
the next sprint during the sprint planning meeting, hold daily stand-up meetings to track progress, conduct a sprint
review at the end of the sprint, and hold a retrospective to identify areas for improvement.

### Scrumban:

Scrumban is a hybrid of Kanban and Scrum that combines the best of both methodologies. Scrumban aims to improve the
flexibility and flow of Kanban while retaining the structure and teamwork of Scrum. Teams using Scrumban typically focus
on continuous improvement, limiting work in progress, and optimizing flow.

Minimum requirements: A physical or digital board, a product backlog, a sprint backlog, a sprint planning meeting, daily
stand-up meetings, a sprint review, and a retrospective.

General process: Create a product backlog of features or user stories, prioritize the backlog items, select items for
the next sprint during the sprint planning meeting, hold daily stand-up meetings to track progress, conduct a sprint
review at the end of the sprint, and hold a retrospective to identify areas for improvement. Use a Kanban board to
visualize work and track progress through the workflow stages.

### Comparison:

- Kanban emphasizes visualizing work, limiting work in progress, and optimizing flow.
- Scrum emphasizes iterative development, teamwork, and continuous improvement.
- Scrumban combines the best of both methodologies, focusing on flexibility, flow, and continuous improvement.
- Kanban has fewer prescribed meetings and ceremonies than Scrum.
- Scrum provides more structure and accountability than Kanban.
- Scrumban is a good option for teams that want the structure of Scrum but the flexibility of Kanban.
- All three methodologies require a product backlog, visual management, and continuous improvement.
