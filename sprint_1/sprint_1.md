## First Sprint Introduction: spoken by Founder and CEO

Welcome to the first sprint of MyWebClass, where we will be focusing on meeting the technical, SEO, and
internationalization requirements for our website. These requirements are essential to ensure that our website is
user-friendly, accessible to all users, and compliant with legal regulations.

Meeting these requirements is crucial because it sets the foundation for our website, allowing us to grow rapidly and
have the processes and tools we need to help a lot of people. We need to keep in mind that our users may come from
different countries, speak different languages, and may have disabilities. Therefore, we need to make sure that our site
is as inclusive as possible and that everyone can access the content that we offer.

We also need to make sure that our community of customers feels that we value their privacy and are making our best
attempt at complying with all applicable legal technical requirements. Compliance with legal and business requirements
is essential for creating a successful and legally compliant website or web application.

Meeting these requirements not only helps to ensure that our website is accessible and compliant, but it can also
improve the user experience and ultimately lead to better engagement and business outcomes.

Let's work together to meet these requirements and create a website that is inclusive, accessible, and legally
compliant. By doing so, we will create a solid foundation for our website that will allow us to grow and help people
from all over the world.
