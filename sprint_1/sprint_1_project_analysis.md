# Project Requirement Analysis


# Overview.

Welcome, As part of this course, you will be required to develop a website for a MyWebClass.org. To help
you get started, I have provided you with an overview of the project requirements. It is essential that you read through
these requirements carefully and follow the instructions provided to develop the necessary project documentation. The
project documentation should be submitted in the format specified in the assignment guidelines. Please note that this is
a crucial component of the project, and careful attention must be given to ensure that you meet all the requirements
outlined. Good luck with your project!"

# Assignment Instructions

## Step 1 - Create a rough draft of Themes, Initiatives, and Epics for the project:

### Read the project requirements below and the Project Analysis Scenario Section after these instructions:

1. Conduct legal research for the website, implement necessary changes, perform testing and resolve any issues that
   arise.
2. Conduct research and implement internationalization features for the website, perform testing and resolve any issues
   that arise.
3. Conduct SEO research, implement changes, perform testing and resolve any issues that arise.
4. Conduct web accessibility research, implement changes, perform testing and resolve any issues that arise.
5. Develop a responsive content template and homepage for the website.
6. Implement GDPR requirements with Google Analytics using Consent API and Javascript.
7. Develop and perform testing with automated tests that can be used to measure site performance in the browser using
   Playwright
8. Set up a deployment that all members of your team can see to view the progress of the sprint
9. Measure deployment times and research ways to improve them and implement measurable improvements
10. Measure automated test times and research ways to improve them and implement measurable improvements
11. Create easy-to-understand and reliable instructions for installing the project on the developers mac or Windows
    computer
12. Create easy-to-understand instructions and scripts to deploy the project and if necessary how to set up the
    development server

## Step 2 - Break Down Epics into Smaller User Stories:

- Divide the epics into smaller user stories to make it easier to manage the project and track progress.
    - Write down each user story separately.
    - Each Story should be written from the customer or business point of view and consist of one measurable task i.e.
      it can be tested manually or automated

## Step 3 - Prioritize User Stories:

- Determine the importance and urgency of each user story.
- Prioritize the user stories based on their significance and start with the most critical ones.

## Step 4 - Estimate Effort Required:

- Estimate the amount of time and resources needed to complete each user story.
- Note down the estimation for each user story.

## Step 5 - Assign Story Points:

- Assign story points to each user story based on its estimated effort required.
- Use the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.) to assign story points to each user story.

## Step 6 - Define Acceptance Criteria:

- Create a list of acceptance criteria for each user story.
- Clearly define what must be accomplished for each user story to be considered complete.
- Define positive and negative situations such as user entering in wrong data o making a mistake somehow

## Step 7 - Assign the user story to a team member and set a deadline for the task:

- Keep track of the progress of the project regularly.
- Ensure that user stories are being completed on time and according to the defined acceptance criteria.
- If any issues arise, make necessary adjustments to the project plan.
- Set deadlines early, so you have time to account for unexpected situations. Consider using Google Calendar or some
  other way to keep track of time. GitHub Project isn't very good at visualizing this
- Each Team Member is responsible for adding their user stories as issues to the project board in GitHub.
    - Take a screenshot after you load all your tasks into the project board and include it in the project analysis
      report.
## Step 8 - Hold a Sprint Retrospective Meeting or Discuss on the Discussion Board In Canvas
- Discuss how you can improve the requirement analysis and creation of the agile documents for the next sprint

# Submission Instructions
- Create a PowerPoint with your team during a meeting to capture your ideas for the agile documentation.
- All of your project documentation should be added to your repository's wiki see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis) for instructions on github wiki.
- Each team member must create a document and include a picture of their tasks after they initially add them to the task board
- Add a link to your project wiki to the document 
- Write a summary of your sprint retrospective for how your can improve this project requirement analysis and documentation writing in the future. 
- Submit the documents to canvas

# Project Analysis Scenario
## Project Introduction: Spoken by the CEO

Hey there, web wizards and tech enthusiasts! As the CEO of MyWebClass.org, I am excited to embark on a journey to create
a website that will knock your socks off! But how do we ensure that we create a website that truly meets the needs of
our users while delivering a top-notch experience? Let me tell you, it all starts with a solid foundation.

By focusing on the design and basic requirements of the website and limiting the use of technology early on, we can
build a foundation that's easier to build upon later. And you know what? We'll be moving at lightning speed through the
early stages of development thanks to static pages that require less technical expertise!

But wait, there's more! We're also adopting a lean methodology that prioritizes the most valuable features and functions
based on user needs. No unnecessary complexity or features that don't add value here! And with the help of our trusty
user feedback, we'll be creating a more user-friendly and effective website.

Now, let's talk project management! We're going agile, baby! And that means we've got some seriously detailed
documentation at each level: themes, initiatives, epics, and user stories. But don't worry, we'll make it fun with some
acceptance criteria to measure if we're meeting our goals and delivering a product that meets your needs.

And we can't forget about story points! These little gems are a way of measuring the complexity of a task or user story,
helping us estimate the effort required to complete the work. It's like a game of difficulty ratings, and we're rating
our legal research user stories at a 5-point task for some moderate complexity and our terms and conditions user stories
at a 3-point task for less complexity.

So there you have it, folks! We're building a solid foundation, prioritizing your needs, and having some fun with our
agile project management. Let's create a website that blows your mind!

# Understanding the Requirements of a Webpage / Website

## Technical Requirements

When creating a website or webpage, meeting technical requirements is essential to ensure that the website is
user-friendly, accessible to all users, and optimized for search engines. The technical requirements that must be met
include the use of semantic markup to make it clear what content is and how it relates to the page as a whole. This
means that alternative text descriptions must be provided for images to aid visually impaired users, and captions,
transcripts, or audio descriptions for video and audio content. Forms must have proper labels and error messages, links
should be descriptive and indicate their purpose, and text should have sufficient contrast with the background.
Additionally, keyboard navigation must be possible, sites must be optimized for fast loading times, and they should be
responsive and accessible on different devices. By meeting these technical requirements, web developers and designers
can create websites and web applications that are both functional and user-friendly.

### Key Points

- Semantic markup to make it clear what content is and how it relates to the page as a whole
- Alternative text descriptions for images to aid visually impaired users
- Captions, transcripts, or audio descriptions for video and audio content
- Proper labels and error messages for forms
- Descriptive links indicating their purpose
- Sufficient contrast between text and background
- Keyboard navigation
- Optimized for fast loading times
- Responsive and accessible on different devices

## SEO Requirements

Creating a website or webpage that is accessible, well-structured, and optimized for search engines requires meeting a
variety of technical and legal/business requirements. These requirements are designed to ensure that websites are
user-friendly, accessible to all users, and compliant with legal regulations.

From a technical perspective, websites must be designed with semantic markup that makes it clear to users and search
engines what the content is and how it relates to the page as a whole. This means that images must have alternative text
descriptions so that visually impaired users can understand the content, and video and audio content must have captions,
transcripts, or audio descriptions. Forms must have proper labels and error messages, links should be descriptive and
indicate their purpose, and text should have sufficient contrast with the background. Keyboard navigation must be
possible, sites must be optimized for fast loading times, and they should be responsive and accessible on different
devices.

In addition to technical requirements, there are also a number of SEO requirements that must be met. This includes the
use of appropriate meta tags, descriptive URLs, proper use of heading tags, relevant and high-quality content, and
internal linking. Structured data is also important for rich snippets in search results.

### Key Points

- Use appropriate meta tags
- Descriptive URLs
- Proper use of heading tags
- Relevant and high-quality content
- Internal linking
- Structured data for rich snippets in search results

## Internationalization Requirements

Internationalization requirements include the use of appropriate language attributes, character encoding that supports
multiple languages, and localized URLs and content. Proper use of currency symbols and formatting ensures that users
understand the currency being used on a webpage.

### Key Points

- Appropriate language attributes
- Character encoding that supports multiple languages
- Localized URLs and content
- Proper use of currency symbols and formatting
- Proper use of date and time formats

## Legal

Legal and business requirements are also important for website creation. This includes compliance with copyright laws
and regulations, proper handling of user data and privacy policies, and compliance with industry-specific regulations
such as HIPAA for healthcare or FINRA for finance. Websites must also comply with local laws and regulations such as the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe.

To ensure compliance with these requirements, there are several free tools and resources available. For example, the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide detailed guidelines for making web content more accessible to users with
disabilities. Google Analytics and Google Search Console can help track website traffic and identify areas for
improvement. Creative Commons provides free licenses for sharing and using copyrighted content, as well as legal
templates and guides for creating privacy policies and disclaimers.

Compliance with industry-specific regulations, such as those related to healthcare or finance, may also be necessary
depending on the nature of the website or web application. For example, healthcare-related websites must comply with
HIPAA regulations, which govern the privacy and security of personal health information. Similarly, financial websites
must comply with regulations such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (
PCI DSS).

Proper attribution of third-party content and sources is also an important legal requirement. This involves properly
citing any images, text, or other content used on the website that is not original. This helps to avoid issues with
copyright infringement and plagiarism.

Finally, compliance with local laws and regulations may also be necessary. For example, in Europe, websites must comply
with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which governs the collection, use, and storage of personal data.
Understanding and complying with all of these legal and business requirements is essential for creating a successful and
legally compliant website or web application.

### Key Points

- Compliance with copyright laws and regulations
- Proper handling of user data and privacy policies
- Compliance with industry-specific regulations
- Compliance with local laws and regulations
- Proper Attribution of Third-Party Content and Sources
- Give credit to any third-party content or sources used
- Establish credibility and trust with users
- Compliance with Local Laws and Regulations (e.g. GDPR in Europe)
- Understand and comply with specific laws and regulations
- Avoid legal issues and penalties

## Tools and Resources

- To ensure that all of these technical and legal/business requirements are met, there are a variety of free tools and
  resources available. By leveraging these resources, web developers and designers can create websites and web
  applications that are both functional and legally compliant. Meeting these requirements not only helps to ensure that
  a website is accessible and compliant, but it can also improve the user experience and ultimately lead to better
  engagement and business outcomes.

### Key Points

- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
- Google Analytics and Google Search Console
- Creative Commons
- WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool
- Markup Validation Service
- Localize
- TermsFeed
